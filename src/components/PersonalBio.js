        My journey into tech started back in the early 90s when my father
        introduced me to Commander Keen on a 5.25in floppy disk, but as I have
        gotten older, I have found other uses for computers than just video
        games. My first jump into technology was when I built a database in
        Microsoft Access to track the maintenance performed on rental equipment
        when I worked for an event company. At the beginning of 2021, I decided
        to pursue a full-time career in web development and submitted my
        application to Nashville Software School, and started my yearlong boot
        camp in July.
