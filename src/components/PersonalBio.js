      <h3 className="bio-text-title">A little about me.</h3>
      <p className="bio-text-body">
        I like flannel shirts and building things. I like team environments and
        project management. Most of all, I like learning.
      </p>
      <p className="bio-text-body">
        My road into technology started when I built a Microsoft Access database
        to help me track the repairs and maintenance performed on an array of
        equipment that was rented out on a weekly basis. Over the course of
        several weeks, I learned the basics of Access and built an application
        that met the needs of the companyâ€™s maintenance shop and made my life
        easier.
      </p>
      <p className="bio-text-body">
        Since then, I have started to embrace technology as much as possible in
        my day-to-day work life and over the years it has grown into a passion
        for helping create tools that not only help me but also the teams I am a
        part of work more efficiently.
      </p>
      <p className="bio-text-body">
        It was this passion that drove me into signing up for the NSS boot camp
        with the goal of pursuing a career as a developer.
